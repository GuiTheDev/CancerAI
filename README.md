# CancerAI
Really basic and simple AI trained to find cancerous tumors and non cancerous tumors. The data given is in cancer.csv and it's less than 600 entries so not so much data, 80% of the data is used for training the remaining 20% is used for testing.

Please do not trust this AI as it was trained with very basic and very few data, and its really basic.
